Marvel Strike Force Team Builder

The Marvel Strike Force Team Builder App will help players build, optimize, and understand what their custom team will be able to accomplish
in game. The user will be presented with a roster of selectable characters that are in game. Their team will be displayed below the Roster section
to allow them to make changes to their team freely. As the team is being built, below the team section will be a list of the characters in game
abilities (Basic, Special, Ultimate, and Passive). This will allow players to build an optimized custom team for events and game modes while
seeing what their abilities do all in one spot.
